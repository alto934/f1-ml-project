All the coding is done in Jupyter Notebooks for easy visualization.\
Run dataset_preprocessing.ipynb  to see all the merging of datasets.\
Run weather_scrape.ipynb  to see how track weather information was obtained from Wikipedia.\
Run random_forest_classifier.ipynb  to see model 1.\
Run logistic.ipynb  to see model 2.\
Run svm_classifier.ipynb  to see model 3.\
Run nn_classifier.ipynb  to see model 4.\
Suggestion: VSCode is a good IDE to run the notebooks.
